# Getting started with Mindi® simulation and PIC18-Q41 microcontrollers
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module in PIC18-Q41 family devices using the Mindi simulation tool.
## Configuration: Connected Directly to Pins
This configuration connects the bare op-amp directly to the pins, allowing any standard op-amp configuration to be achieved by connecting the appropriate external components

Download and open the **Mindi schematic [here](schematics/)**

Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source. Note that the un-connected op-amp example is provided without any standard external circuitry.

### Tweaking
This configuration has no adjustable parameters.

### Don't have Mindi?
Download and install [Mindi simulation tool](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-mindi)
Download and install Mindi model for AVR DB device
